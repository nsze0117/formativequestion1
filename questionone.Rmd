## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
# Function fills the missing Ozone values in the dataset with the column's mean
replace_na_ozone <- function(data) {
  data$Ozone[is.na(data$Ozone)] <- mean(data$Ozone, na.rm = TRUE)
  return(data)
}

# Load the built-in R airquality dataset and apply the function
replaced_airquality <- replace_na_ozone(airquality)

head(replaced_airquality)
```
